# serialscan
Serials (serial_scan &amp; serial_format) is the (CRUD, UI-rich) webApp that allows user input of 
format, assembly number, revision, sale_order and scanner's input of serial number (bar_code scanned result). 

Completed by Zephyr Phuc Tran. 
The project was firstly to build a standalone app. 
Working mechanism was then implemented as a plugin for Mantis (a large-scale issue-tracking webApp).
